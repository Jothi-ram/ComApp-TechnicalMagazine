                                            useful for the people. Such creativity and innovation cannot stem up from formal education alone but most of the time sparks from informal discussions or by observing what is happening around us. Login, an annual
                                            event of PSG Tech creates a forum for young minds to meet, discuss, share, and showcase hidden talents and to see the real identity of themselves.

                                            Login and bringing our Comapp Magazine with thoughts of our students compiled. Such events and publications of magazines not only sharpen the skills of participants but also those of organizers.

                                            One of the many remarkable things about Login is how it has managed to sustain itself as a premier symposium for postgraduate students over the years. It warms my heart to look back and see that this year's edition is the thirtieth. A feat such as this
                                            would not be possible without the constant support of the alumni and the untiring students who work with dedication to stage the event. The legacy of Login and Comapp would never be forgotten, as these bring
                                            the departments and the world around us close together with every new edition. As with Login, we have reached hallmarks in technology over the past few decades and this year's theme - Triades of Digital Progression
                                            pays homage to all that has been and at the same time accounts for the inevitable transitions that are to be made for a technologically and ethically sound future. I commend everyone who has worked towards making
                                            this event a possibility and wish them success.

                                                Let’s wind the clock back by a decade. The world was facing a financial meltdown, led by the US housing crisis. The cause for which was, in simple terms, securitization of loans. It implies the conversion of loans such as credit cards, housing, etc into
                                                debt instruments. “To reduce this risk and increase efficiency, risk management and cost reduction need not be a trade-off anymore”, this became the idea that gave birth to Intain Fintech Pte Ltd and COMAPP
                                                brings you excerpts from an exclusive interview with Mr. Siddhartha, the founder and CEO, Intain Fintech Pte Ltd.<br><br>
                                                <b>“Ideas are a dime a dozen, people who implement them are priceless”. What was the driving force behind your decision to start Intain?</b><br> Since the financial crisis in 2008, the compliance burden
                                                kept increasing and there existed cost pressures forcing the need to improve efficiency and we were entering a stage where improving compliance or reducing risk and improving efficacy always seemed like
                                                a tradeoff. I had a fantastic team on Artificial Intelligence working under me and we'd worked on some interesting projects with MIT on trade processing. I realized that it was time to try and see how we
                                                could combine the ideas behind Blockchain and AI to reduce risk and improve efficiency at the same time. Thus, with what technology had to offer us now, reducing risk and reducing cost need not be a tradeoff
                                                anymore. We picked one of the triggers of the financial crisis, which is Asset Securitisation, and decided to address the problem - one that had led to one of the economic meltdowns in the last 70-80 years.<br><br>
                                                <b>You have worked in various aspects of Financial Services and are now working in AI and Blockchain technology. Having witnessed a lot of changes over the years, how would you describe the journey?</b>                                                <br> Most of my career has been in financial services operations, where in a way, I was on the other side of the fence as a consumer of technology, to use it to make our operations faster, cheaper etc.,
                                                while reducing the inherent risks. Now that we are providers of that technology, where we are helping other financial services operations do the same, I believe we can empathize with our customers, understand
                                                their problems and build a product accordingly. The journey overall has been exciting because I have personally seen the way we have scaled and managed an operation with nearly 14000 people, trillions of
                                                dollars in Assets under Admin and Custody etc. and now we’re managing an organization with 30-40 people over the last 15 months, all of whom are AI engineers or Blockchain engineers with the desire and the
                                                ability to change the world. It is a big change, but exciting nevertheless.<br><br> In February, your startup had launched the product Emulya, with the objective of asset securitization. Can you tell us
                                                about it and its reception in the industry?<br> As I mentioned earlier, we were convinced that we could combine both AI and Blockchain in a manner that would reduce risk and be efficient at the same time.
                                                For obvious reasons, we picked one of the triggers of the financial crisis and decided to work on the problem. While it takes time to adapt to new technologies, the response we’ve had from the industry has
                                                surprised us, in terms of how positive it has been. In the last six weeks alone, we’ve signed on with two trustees, who will be using our platform, to make the whole interaction between the servicer, the
                                                trustee and the investor completely seamless. While the fear factor earlier would’ve been that the intermediaries would be hesitant to adopt technologies like Blockchain which are going to dis-intermediate,
                                                what we are observing is that these intermediaries, who by law and regulation have a role today, are adopting these technologies to improve efficiency.<br><br>
                                                <b>Karnataka has invited experts via hackathons to integrate Blockchain technology into the e-governance system. Telangana State is actively promoting an ecosystem for Blockchain Technology. In comparison, how well-received is Blockchain technology in Tamilnadu?</b><br>                                                I do not believe I’m well equipped to answer this question, as we do not work with government services, nor does our technology cater to governments as such. However, just as an observer, my viewpoint is
                                                that Blockchain is conceptually good for a lot of government use cases including land records and so forth. The issue however concerning Blockchain, is that it is ‘garbage in, garbage out’ and unless our
                                                land records are made clean and titles are undisputed, moving such data into a Blockchain might make matters worse. I am not an expert and hence I cannot compare Tamil Nadu and other states.<br><br>
                                                <b>What was the biggest challenge you faced when you were starting Intain? How did you overcome it?</b> <br> Overcoming challenges at an early stage in a journey sounds presumptuous. We are faced with challenges
                                                even today, some of which may seem insurmountable. Our biggest challenge, however, was probably the fact that we started, coupled with an NBFC in India and the plan was to make them a smart lender and, in
                                                many ways, create a conveyor belt using Blockchain to be able to finance that NBFC through asset securitization. The NBFC faced several challenges in its lending business, which would have made our financing
                                                proposition completely redundant. Thus, within four to five months of our formation, once we realized that the situation wasn’t going to be sustainable in the long term, we had to launch the product in the
                                                market and make it a third-party product that would be sold to other financial institutions. Within two months of this occurrence, we had to tap into the US market which is more than half the world's Securitisation
                                                market.So that is one tough challenge, early in our journey, that we managed to get through reasonably unscathed. <br><br>
                                                <b>What are the essential skills required for a student to secure a position in your company?</b> <br> To put it in a broad perspective, we are a two-skills company. We work on blockchain and hence we have
                                                Golang and Solidity developers. We also work on Artificial Intelligence and hence we have Python developers with strong math background. Speaking for ourselves, in the Blockchain team, instead of specific
                                                programming skills in Golang and Solidity, we look for top-notch programmers. Most of our programmers come with a background in either C or C++, with extremely strong fundamentals. So, if you have great
                                                programming skills, you would get into our Blockchain team and you will learn about Blockchain along with Golang, Solidity etc. In the Artificial Intelligence team, besides Python, we seek a strong fundamental
                                                background in Mathematics and Statistics, because we are not seeking developers, we are seeking R&D engineers, and hence we require a strong combination of mathematics and programming.<br><br>
                                                <b>What advice would you give the students starting their careers in these changing times?</b><br> I won’t speak for the industry, but I do have strong views on this matter. Having seen and been a part of
                                                it for more than a decade and a half now, I believe what has happened because of the IT boom is, that most of the Computer Science programs, outside the top 15-20 institutions became vocational training
                                                courses to churn out JAVA and Dot.Net programmers and so on. So we started producing programmers, not Computer Science engineers, and that remains a challenge when we hire. For instance, for the Blockchain
                                                team we hired students with very poor fundamental programming skills, even though they may be decent programmers in specific languages. We need Golang developers and nobody is trained in the language. So,
                                                one needs strong fundamentals so that he/she can pick up any language, and such qualities are generally lacking. Secondly, with respect to our AI team, there are people with great skills in mathematics but
                                                poor programming skills or vice-versa. In contrast, when I was at NIT Warangal in mid-90s most of the Computer Science students were good at mathematics as well, given how the program in Computer Science
                                                was structured to have a large chunk of content in mathematics. Also, post-graduate courses in Computer Science comprise mainly of mathematics, something which I believe has been diluted in today’s curriculum.
                                                I believe that people today in their bachelor’s degree need to primarily focus on building their fundamentals in Computer Science. Understandably, job requirements can force a student to pick up a language
                                                which can fetch him/her a job easily, but focusing too much on that front can kill the versatility and their ability to adapt in the industry, which is critical, given the rate at which the industry is changing.<br><br>                                                We, at team Comapp, would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Siddhartha for his valuable time and wish him all the success in his future endeavors. <br><br>

                                    Video Assistant Referee is the latest and the most efficient technology used in the game of Soccer. It is a video which is used to assist or help the referee during the match.<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                                    It was first tested by Netherlands Football Association in 2012-13 at Dutch top division League (Eredivisie). VAR trials were first implemented in Major League Soccer which is America’s top division league in 2016.
                                    Australia’s A-league was the first event to implement VAR, officially in 2017. Now it has become a revolution in the world of Football. After the first trial of VAR, the technology is used efficiently.<br> &nbsp &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It can be used to review the goal decisions, direct red card incidents, penalty decisions and foul decisions. On-field referee decisions can be overturned. FIFA World Cup 2018, was the first
                                    Global Event which implemented VAR technology. Most of the teams got benefitted. People started to know about VAR because of its final or game turning decision in FIFA. After the World cup, most of the European top
                                    division leagues and European Tournaments have started implementing VAR technology in play.<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It helps to make decisions during nail-biting finishes. This technology is also a reason
                                    for the failure in the flow of game as the team cannot celebrate the goal instantly until it confirms the decision. The team’s morale can also be damaged in the possession of the game when the favoured decision is turning
                                    back against them.<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thus, VAR is now the greatest revolution in the football world and soon every country will implement the VAR technology.

Order of magnitude increase in bandwidth and more people
                                    on the communications channel meant that is not just humans who should be excited, but machines too. 5G enables a world where machines can talk to each other seamlessly. The 5G world is exciting but who gets to live
                                    in that world?</p>
                                <img src="images\5G.PNG" class="art" />
                                <p style="padding:3px 65px 35px 65px;text-align: justify">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The standardisation steps for 6G has already begun and we don't know what it will bring to the table but, surely, It will be something beyond wireless communication like distributed computing.
                                    India has one of the largest telecommunication infrastructures in the world. According to OpenSignal, India is way past the UK in 4G LTE availability but has terrible speeds (8.7 Mbps, South Korea - 65 Mbps). One can
                                    see 5G as a solution to bridging the speed and availability gap but it is not as easy as we think it is. What is 5G?<br> 5G is the 5th generation cellular network technology. Every network technology will be allocated
                                    a range in the spectrum for communication. For 5G, the current allocations are low-band(600 - 900 MHz), mid-band(2.5 - 4.2 GHz) and millimetre wave(24 GHz, 28 GHz, 37 GHz, 39 GHz and 47 GHz). All the super fast communication
                                    will fall under the millimetre wave band(mmwave). 5G is not just about higher download speeds, It is also about the changes in the network infrastructure that makes it unique. The following are some of the innovations
                                    in 5G tech.
                                    <br>1. Small Cell - small cells have been around for a long time to boost signals indoors. Since millimeter waves have shorter wavelengths they are prone to scattering. So 5G deployment necessitates the use of small
                                    cell to compensate scattering
                                    <br>2. Massive MIMO (mMIMO) - It improves the capacity of the network, bringing more people online. It can also power a wide range of devices like IoT, Self-driving cars, AR/VR, mobile phones etc
                                    <br>3. Beam Forming - It is an intelligent way of concentrating a beam on the specific target. For example, in a moving car antennas can specifically target the car without targeting the surrounding making it more power-efficient
                                    and providing high speeds
                                    <br>4. Full Duplex - With 5G, Devices will be able to send and receive data at the same on the same frequency, which is not possible with the current 4G tech
                                    <br>The Digital Divide<br> A digital divide is any uneven distribution in the access to, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies(ICT) between any number of distinct groups. These groups may be
                                    defined based on social, geographical, or geopolitical criteria, or otherwise - Wikipedia<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Though 5G marks a major leap forward in wireless tech which could transform the world
                                    around us, it is also concerning that who gets to live in that world. The problem is in implementing 5G. 5G's fastest speeds are carried by the millimeter waves and they suffer from scattering by walls, rainfall and
                                    even humans as they are near the microwave spectrum. A decent rain will block your 5G connection. To work around this problem, companies propose to place multiple small cells around an area to boost the signal. The
                                    multiple antenna solutions make sense for a crowded city but in rural and suburban areas it is not worth the investments for the companies where there are not so many people to use the connection. But inevitably, the
                                    services for 2G and 3G will be slowly retired pushing people more towards 4G and 5G. There are a lot of other problems, infrastructure for 5G costs a lot of money which influences the tariffs. Devices are also going
                                    to need special 5G chipsets to enjoy 5G services. So is 5G technology for the affluent? 5G can make the digital divide more visible if not deployed evenly. The IMT 2020 standards which is the standard for 5G is due
                                    in 2020, so we don't know what 5G exactly is. Then what about the 5G plans available now, aren't they real 5G? They are trail implementations of 5G, companies need public support to test and find out implementation
                                    problems of these technologies and to know whether it is worth investing in the tech like the Marvel movies where the hype needs to be built before the shows land in theatres. 5G makes huge promises, but if that benefits
                                    only the privileged class, should we be excited or concerned? References

                                <h3 class="heading">A few thoughts on Technology</h3><br>
                                <p style="padding:3px 65px 35px 65px;text-align: justify">
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So, Where do you think would be the greatest technological marvel in the next decade?”. I was posed with this question as a part of a group activity, where we had to identify a niche area where technology could play a major
                                    role in the near future. My peers were from different scientific fields, and I was certainly expecting a fiery discussion, where each promote their own discipline. I was going to do that too with computer science, but
                                    I hoped to provide strong backup for my case. I really wanted my answer to be unique. The jury comprised of experts in computer science and management studies, and impressing them was certainly not the last thing on
                                    my mind. But to do that, I had to settle on one among the plethora of options I had in my head and focus on justifying it. <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My immediate inclination
                                    was towards sustainability and how computing as a source of technological innovation could be used in designing a structured and phased approach to achieve that. The idea seemed good in my head. We have come a long
                                    way since the industrial revolution and each invention since then has had a great degree of co-existence with their contemporary human community. At what cost though? Emissions have taken the biosphere somewhere irreparable,
                                    and with the requirements of the society in terms of “emission-causing” devices and services at an all time high, it is impossible to cut them out too. We have been concerned about this, only since data on the criticality
                                    of the problem have been collected and made available. With the problem now phrased, if not detailed in my head, I began exploring potential avenues for fixes. One thing I realized is that there is no single “solution”
                                    to achieve total sustainability. Reducing emission ratio for power generation, developing bio-sustainable polymers and plastics, ecological delineation of biosphere hotspots, preserving geographic bodies and sustainable
                                    running of civic communities were the first sub-problems which I could think of. Each a separate sect of its own, requiring serious work and study at the intersection of natural sciences and engineering. <br> &nbsp
                                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is a collaborative task, but I was dead set on identifying where I could make a positive contribution as a computing scientist, before taking the daunting step of posing the problem my peers.
                                    I figured I could prove a better case if I could see myself working on the problem. Obviously, I couldn’t come up with something clever enough to revolutionize the way sustainability has been perceived (in a few minutes,
                                    to be fair to myself), but everything ultimately fizzled down to two fundamental aspects of computing: data and optimization. With data available from the array of scientific experiments, “smart” devices, weather patterns
                                    and chemical readings, the next phase would be to design models which positively optimize the impact of at least a small section of the various sub-problems in sustainable growth. With time passing swiftly, I thought
                                    it would be better to discuss this with the group to get more streamlined ideas.<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp when I was preparing to present my initial views having these as my mental note, I realised that I had
                                    misinterpreted the question. It was in fact “What would be the greatest technological innovation in the next decade”, rather than where. This made me cringe at myself. I had made the most fundamental error of not understanding
                                    what was required of me. In the meantime, there was an intense discussion within my group on choosing between cost-efficient space travel and wacky devices, built to be the Swiss army knife of televised entertainment.
                                    I couldn’t come across myself to contribute meaningfully to this discussion, but I did think about this direction, and my thoughts led me to this new perspective. <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Technology is growing
                                    exponentially and this is inevitable. But, would a common user be able to perceive all its facets? I have had trouble in the past to understand and use several features of my mobile device. Despite studying computers,
                                    I have a hard time handling exceptions, error messages and troubleshooting issues. The rapid advancement in technology has a serious bottleneck with the limited comprehending capacity of users and this is a serious
                                    issue. The user dialogue is such an important component of the device, that its success and failure may entirely depend on it. With the recent advent of innovative means to realize an electronic system and huge emphasis
                                    on how a computing device perceives a user, this could be something to discuss with a panel of experts! <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Despite my earlier concern about my ability to contribute to the discussion,
                                    I pitched this with my group, but was immediately shot down. They had already decided to go with the ingenious system which agglomerates the now “disjointed” features of the entertainment industry under a single umbrella.
                                    To be honest, it was an interesting pitch, a commercial pitch. Just that I couldn’t relate how it would positively impact the society apart from, well, entertaining. <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the session
                                    drawing to a close, I couldn’t help but notice an uncanny link between my thought bubbles. Sustainability strives to modify people’s lifestyle - individually and as a community. All the solutions of the computing problems
                                    aim to identify some mean, some measures which ultimately aid in our long-term progress. And as for the interaction between humans and systems, that facilitates how well we use the technological solution in hand. A
                                    dustbin is not smart, but it still conveys the information on how to use it to the best effect - which wastes to dispose and which to recycle. Although a crude example of the aforementioned interaction, this is still
                                    something not many have a hang on. I haven’t got the hang of it. Every electronic device has particular instructions on their safe disposal. Although this information is accessible, we don’t seek for it. This has direct
                                    implications on emission levels, and this leads back to the problem of sustainable living. Only a slim faction of people work on designing solutions for contemporary community-wide problems, but it is the people as
                                    a whole, who must work to understand the proper dimensions of the solution presented in the discourse and put it to good use. <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ultimately, it is education. Education would be the broad
                                    spectrum to answer both versions of the question. I thought this to myself as I walked away.

                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Virtual Reality(VR) is a concept that is familiar all over the world. Many of us partake in fun activities which have different elements of VR in them. VR is considered to be an innovative and highly appreciated technological
                                            invention. It is a budding entertainment industry that caters to all ages.<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Without our realization, a veil stands between the real
                                            and the virtual world, one which needs to be analyzed and explored. We have always parted that veil and scoured either side of it but never the veil itself. On one hand, we have Virtual Reality with no semblance
                                            of anything practical or logical, it is simply made up of extreme scenarios. This is where augmented reality(AR) comes into play. Augmented reality is essentially a perfect balance of what is real and virtual.
                                            It enhances our perceptions of the real world and helps us focus on important things pertaining to the situation in hand. <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A doctor may prepare for an operation using VR to
                                            visualize an entire patient, operate on him/her multiple times, and identify the perfect strategy to employ during the actual operation. AR will be used during the actual operation-to see real time status of
                                            the patient’s various vitals, overlay reference videos with that of the actual patient, receive tips and guidelines from compiled data (this falls under AI), get an enhanced view of the site of operation in
                                            the person’s body, etc. Similarly, a pilot’s display of compiled data can be aligned or arrayed on the real life situation itself, in a view which resembles that of a binocular. As difficult it may be to wrap
                                            your head around it, it is crucial. <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While AR has been developing in many spheres, there are some fields that have been using it for some time now. Examples include architecture,
                                            navigation, 3D projections and camera filters. Camera filters use the concept of augmented reality, wherein our faces are shown differently but still the original identity of our faces remain. If a person looks
                                            at your photo, after some scrutiny, they will be able to identify that it’s you. <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are two sides to every coin and the same applies here. A famous example of the dark side
                                            of AR is Pokémon Go, which is well-known for issues caused by its rules and nature of engaging the player. Modification of reality by AR may lead to ambiguities. A warped or distorted view of reality sometimes
                                            leads to repercussions on its users. Most AR modules use the likes and dislikes of the user to design the environment. This gives rise to the possibility of people becoming attached to that world and refusing
                                            to accept reality, as in the case of VR as well. Furthermore, games using AR generally collect data personal to the user, thus leading to privacy issues. <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As is the case with
                                            every aspect of innovation, Augmented Reality offers an enticing opportunity to perceive elements of reality from an entirely new perspective while also bringing with it its own set of drawbacks, thus giving
                                            us yet another futuristic goal to work on. <br>

                                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Technological advancements today have attained a point where the deployment of Autonomous weapon systems (AWS) is — practically, if not ethically and legally — feasible within years. The stakes are high; these weapons can
                                                            bring forth a new revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear weapons. While many requisite notions remain to be clarified when it comes to armed drones and targeted killings, advances
                                                            in the development of autonomy in weapons systems are already sufficient grounds for thinking ahead. The notion of so-called Autonomous weapons systems making independent decisions on the use
                                                            of weapons illustrates the requirement to assess the ethicality of even developing them. Military technologies have already incorporated certain elements of autonomy. For example, the United
                                                            States of America’s (USA) Navy Phalanx system automatically defends naval carriers against incoming missiles, as do air-defense systems such as the Patriot Missile system and Israel’s ‘Iron Dome’.
                                                            The United Kingdom’s (UK) ‘fire and forget’ Brimstone missiles are said to be able to find ‘targets’ in a predetermined region without further human involvement.
                                                            <br><br>In simple terms, an Autonomous Weapon System may be one that can select and choose targets of its own accord, enabled by current technology concerning Artificial Intelligence and Robotics
                                                            which can provide the necessary physical platform, perception control, tactical – decision making, navigation etc. For example, the technology already demonstrated for self-driving cars along
                                                            with UK-based tech company Deep Mind’s DQN System could support urban search-and-destroy missions.
                                                            <br><br>The topic of Autonomous Weapons Systems (AWS) does not have a long history within the international arena because AWS have only become a policy issue over the last few years as technology
                                                            has evolved. Thus, because of the burgeoning nature of the topic, there are no binding agreements specifically targeting AWS. However, in recent years, treaty bodies such as the one that oversees
                                                            the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), have held meetings of experts on AWS to begin discussions on pre-emptive moves to address AWS. Moreover, numerous civil society organizations
                                                            have been working together and in conjunction with the United Nations (UN) to promote awareness of the potential impact of AWS and to take definitive action in prohibiting their manufacture and
                                                            implementation.
                                                            <br><br>For the most part, countries agree with the need for 'meaningful human control' over the targeting and engagement decisions made by robotic weapons, which unfortunately, stands undetermined.
                                                            AWS could violate quintessential principles of human dignity by allowing non-living entities to choose whom to kill — for example, they might be tasked to eliminate anyone exhibiting 'threatening
                                                            behavior'. The potential for said technologies to bleed over into peacetime policing functions is evident to human-rights organizations and drone manufacturers.
                                                            <br><br>I believe that the international community must take into account the ethical dimension of the militarization of increasingly autonomous technologies. It appears clear to me that potential
                                                            development and use of Autonomous weapons systems to select and attack targets without meaningful human control raises significant ethical concerns. In my view, the following must be seriously
                                                            considered as we continue to march on towards total autonomy.
                                                            <br><br>Firstly, while the call to outright banning of Autonomous weapons are valid and can be agreeable as it is seen today, it may be wiser to continue to examine the development and deployment
                                                            of such systems under the strict supervision of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Secondly, working towards eliminating the threat of proliferation of such
                                                            weapons systems is necessary, as the effect of these weapons in the wrong hands, can be devastating. Furthermore, stringent establishment of responsibility of War Crimes including Autonomous
                                                            weapons in lieu with the recent discussions at the CCW is certainly a need of the hour. Lastly, underwater activities are more difficult to observe than those on the surface, on land or in the
                                                            air, and therefore we must invite consideration of what levels and types of transparency would be necessary or desirable for increasingly autonomous weaponized technologies in the maritime environment.
                                                            <br><br>On a concluding note, I’d like to say that the status quo of current human battlefield atrocities is unacceptable as we have seen over centuries and it is important that technology in
                                                            its manifold forms must be used to ameliorate the plight of non-combatant people and precious assets.’’

                                                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Let’s start with the very basics. So the AR glasses look like any ordinary pair of glasses. But, the lens is made of partially transparent display. It will not only allow the wearer to see the world, but also infuse some
                                                                            digital images onto the display. As we would have studied in our school physics classes, light has to rebound off some surface and enter our eyes for us to see the object. In
                                                                            the real world there are plenty of objects and we see them clearly. But, to infuse digital images, we need to add some other things. We require LEDs and OLEDs that can generate
                                                                            these images. All the light that comes is put together and filtered through a device called the “combiner”. Essentially, this device is what “combines”, as the name suggests,
                                                                            the light from the real world and the artificially created light. <br><br> OK, we have digital images,
                                                                            but the glasses are worn so close to the eyes, so how do we see these images clearly? It’s all done by the combiner. There have been many attempts to get a clear, comfortable
                                                                            view in these glasses since the late 1960s. But in the end it boils down to a combination of resolution, field of view, weight of the glasses and other factors such as the aesthetics.
                                                                            One would like the maximum field of view and a crisp resolution of the images. That is, we’re looking to look good while looking at stuff that look good. But this level of perfection
                                                                            has only been achieved by Tony Stark. All we have is a trade-off.<br><br> There are two main types of combiners that achieve this traded-off result. The first is the polarized
                                                                            beam combiner. It combines light from multiple sources based on polarization angles. This is cheaper and doesn’t give very high resolution or very high field of view. But, the
                                                                            glasses will be lighter and more comfortable. We can get around 23 degree FOV with 1280x720p resolution.<br><br> To get higher quality resolutions, heavier combiners are required.
                                                                            These are called the off-axis, semi-spherical combiners. We can get upto 90 degrees FOV and very high resolution. But this technology is very heavy and not comfortable to wear
                                                                            on a regular basis.<br><br> To overcome this trade-off, a new technology called waveguides has been developed. This, more or less, gets the best of both the old combiners. This
                                                                            technology is very sophisticated and also very hard to design. It’s like a medium weight glass with relatively higher resolutions. The main problem however, is the cost. The research
                                                                            going into this field is also worth Tony Stark’s fortune.<br><br> Now that you know about this a bit, keep your eyes open and keep looking forward to developments in this technology.
                                                                            There is a lot more to come here.<br><br>

It can be achieved through the technology that understands the emotional states of human beings called Affective Computing. More than 20 years ago the term affective computing

                                                                            for future processing. Emotions are read from voice and visual inputs including gestures and facial expressions. Speech and gesture recognition are explored mainly by means of
                                                                            affective computing. In the case of facial expressions, muscle movements during speech reflects the emotions that a person can be feeling. Lips, eyebrows, mouth, nose, and other
                                                                            facial muscles discloses the emotions that the person feels. According to the proverb “Face is the index of mind”, even when a person tries to act, their face reveals the truth.
                                                                            Affective computing technology used in the field of emotion detection works in an analogous way to the ones used with speech like detecting a face, identifying the crucial points
                                                                            in the face which disclose the emotion expressed, and processing their positions to decide what emotion is being detected. Thus, Affective Computing is relatively a new field

This may mean many things to you based on what your interests are, but for a person who indulges in making machines learn, this is their cornerstone. Machine learning, as we know it today, rides on correlating
                                                                            data and making inferences out of them. The scale on which machine learning models are employed doesn’t have to be stressed as it is common knowledge. However, this advent of
                                                                            mainstream usage of such techniques causes some disagreements and discomforts.<br><br> Sample the case
                                                                            of Amazon and its automated recruitment engine. In 2014, the machine learning team had built a system that reviewed a job application and decide if the person was to progress
                                                                            to further rounds of evaluation. This seemed like a good idea - after all, this was making the list of potential candidates succinct which meant that the human recruiters could
                                                                            focus their energy on only the best suited candidates. Life went on at Amazon and the recruiters considered the decisions of this system. But in 2015, the team that built this
                                                                            engine started noticing something devastating. <br><br>The engine seemed to have a huge bias towards men and resumes that contained traits of “masculinity”. The model that was
                                                                            built picked up features that were unrelated to recruitment to a product based company and there was not much that the engineers could do. The project was eventually shut down.
                                                                            This brings me back to correlation. The engine at Amazon correlated various traits that were prevalent across previously selected candidates and came up with a model that favored
                                                                            the most common ones.<br><br> But the clinching question is that if these correlations model the real world. This is one of the questions that the field of Explainability tries
                                                                            to answer. One possible approach is to shift from correlation models to causal models.<br><br> Causal models would be those that identify the cause rather than identify the occurrence
                                                                            of an event based on other correlated events. An example would be that smoking is highly correlated with alcoholism, but one does cause the other. A variable such as “lifestyle”
                                                                            is the cause. Building models that learn causation, however, is still a topic of research.<br><br> The other challenges in Explainability are that of countering opaqueness and
                                                                            catering to need for explanation of user who are not ML experts. The latter is very important as can be seen in the case of Amazon’s engine. A rejected candidate would like to
                                                                            know the reason behind their rejection rather than some specificities of the deciding model.<br><br> With the world asking for autonomous, human-interaction less systems, the
                                                                            surfacing concern is that of ethics and explanation of decisions. Current approaches to Artificial Intelligence, such as Deep Learning, can be termed “black box” since their working
                                                                            is opaque. The advent of GDPR and other similar regulations has made necessary the need to understand the reasons behind a decision.
                                                                            <br><br> Efforts in this field are pioneered by conferences such as FAT* (ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency) and AAAI/ACM AIES (Artificial Intelligences,

The fight for equality sprouted wherever
                                                                            there was bias, and soon enough, there were barely any jobs which women were deemed unfit for; but despite all this, there is some amount of gap that we are struggling to fill.
                                                                            Even today, there are quite a few areas where women are being discriminated, slighted and deemed incompetent. There still exist work-place level discrimination and cases where

The booming field of technology is no stranger to this disparity either.<br><br>                                                                            The tech industry is very vast. It is one of the fastest growing sectors and there are millions of job opportunities available; yet, the bias and the inequality that women face
                                                                            in this sector still remain a problem. In the earlier ages of technological development, women were considered to be the most suitable people for the job. The software and programming
                                                                            part were taken care by women while the hardware installation and the other "manly" jobs were assigned to the men. Women have worked as human computers in large groups such as

                                                                            In countries like South Africa, this percentage is even lesser. According to a survey, only 27 percent of women consider a career in technology compared to the 67 percent of men

This shows the lack of female mentors and also the society riddling the idea that this sector is mainly a "man's job" at a very young age.<br><br>                                                                            There is a dire need to bring in the required change. Talented and skilled women should be identified and given opportunities as equal as that of their male counterparts. One

The fight for equality sprouted wherever there was bias, and soon

The booming field of technology is no stranger to this disparity either.<br><br>                                                                            The tech industry is very vast. It is one of the fastest growing sectors and there are millions of job opportunities available; yet, the bias and the inequality that women face
                                                                            in this sector still remain a problem. In the earlier ages of technological development, women were considered to be the most suitable people for the job. The software and programming

Talented and skilled women should be identified and given opportunities as equal as that of their male counterparts. One

                                                                            least two-thirds can name a famous male achiever in the same field. Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg are known all over the world, but not many would know about Virginia Rometty(CEO,

As the struggle gets hard, the voices need to get louder. The bias and discrimination faced
